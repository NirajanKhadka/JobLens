-   **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
-   **Maintainability**: Modular design for easier debugging and updates
-   **Extensibility**: New scrapers and integrations can be added easily

### Key Benefits

-   **Reduced Complexity**: Straightforward codebase focused on core functionality
-   **Direct Communication**: Components interact directly without complex messaging
-   **Single Process**: Simplified deployment and operation

┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│  Job Element    │    │  Extract URL     │    │  Close Tab      │
│  Detection      │───▶│  (Click Link)    │───▶│  Immediately    │
│                 │    │                  │    │                 │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**

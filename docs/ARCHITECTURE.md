## 🚀 Browser Automation Evolution & Performance

### **Playwright MCP Integration** *(In Progress)*
AutoJobAgent is migrating from traditional Playwright to **Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for enhanced browser automation:

- **🎯 LLM-Friendly**: Uses accessibility snapshots instead of screenshots
- **⚡ Performance**: Structured data extraction without visual parsing
- **🔍 Deterministic**: Eliminates ambiguity of pixel-based interactions
- **🤖 AI-Ready**: Native integration with LLM workflows
- **🛡️ Reliable**: Accessibility tree parsing for consistent results

### **Migration Status**
- ✅ **MCP Server Setup**: Playwright MCP server configured and running
- 🔄 **Browser Client**: Enhanced MCP browser client implementation
- 🔄 **Pipeline Integration**: Scraping stages migrated to MCP calls
- ⏳ **Individual Scrapers**: Monster CA, TowardsAI scraper migration
- ⏳ **Test Updates**: Unit/integration tests updated for MCP
- ⏳ **Documentation**: Complete MCP usage documentation

## 1. System Overview

AutoJobAgent now uses a **monolithic, worker-based architecture**. All microservice, event bus, and service orchestrator patterns have been removed. The system is streamlined for maintainability, performance, and ease of deployment.

### 🚀 **Production Deployment Status**
- ✅ **Unified Entry Point**: `main.py` manages all operations
- ✅ **Worker-Based Scraping**: Parallel job scraping via direct function calls
- ✅ **Job Analysis**: ML-powered job matching in a single process
- ✅ **Health Monitoring**: System checks via direct calls
- ✅ **Metrics Collection**: Performance data tracked in-process

### **Architecture Principles**
- **Simplicity**: Direct function calls, no inter-process messaging
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles a distinct concern
- **Performance**: No service communication overhead
- **Maintainability**: Fewer moving parts, easier debugging
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new scrapers, ATS systems, and features

### **Key Benefits Achieved**
- **Reduced Complexity**: 50+ src items → 23 core files/folders
- **Production Ready**: Auto-scraping, health monitoring, graceful shutdown
- **Direct Communication**: No event bus, no service orchestrator
- **Unified Deployment**: Single process, easier scaling

    except MCPUnavailableError:
        # Fallback to traditional Playwright
        return await scrape_with_playwright(keyword)
```

#### **Performance Monitoring**
- **MCP Success Rate**: Track successful MCP operations
- **Fallback Usage**: Monitor Playwright fallback frequency

## Worker Pool & Orchestration Controls (2025 Update)

The dashboard now supports real-time management of job processing workers via a Worker Pool section:

- **Frontend UI:**
  - Displays all workers with status, resource usage, and control buttons.
  - Orchestration controls (Start All, Stop All, Restart All) allow bulk management.
  - UI updates instantly via WebSocket.

- **Backend Endpoints:**
  - `/api/system/start_worker`, `/stop_worker`, `/worker_status` for individual control and status.
  - `/api/system/start_all_workers`, `/stop_all_workers`, `/restart_all_workers` for orchestration.

- **WebSocket Integration:**
  - Backend broadcasts worker status changes to all connected dashboard clients.

### Sequence Example: Start All Workers
1. User clicks "Start All" in the dashboard UI.
2. Frontend sends POST to `/api/system/start_all_workers`.
3. Backend starts all worker processes, then broadcasts new status via WebSocket.
4. All connected dashboards update their Worker Pool UI in real time.

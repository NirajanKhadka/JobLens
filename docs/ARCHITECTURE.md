The autonomous processor includes effective web scraping capabilities to extract critical information:

1.  **Experience Level Detection**: Parses job descriptions to classify experience requirements (entry, mid, senior, expert) using regex and keyword analysis.
2.  **Salary Information Extraction**: Identifies salary ranges and compensation details in various formats, factoring this into the scoring algorithm.
3.  **Job Type Classification**: Determines if positions are remote, hybrid, or onsite by analyzing job description keywords, prioritizing remote and hybrid opportunities.
4.  **Requirements Analysis**: Extracts technical skills, programming languages, frameworks, and tools, matching them against the user's profile capabilities.

#### Improved Scoring Algorithm

The scoring system (0-100 points) evaluates job suitability based on multiple factors:

-   **Title Analysis** (30 points): Assesses relevance of keywords and seniority.
-   **Company Reputation** (15 points): Considers preferred companies and industry standing.
-   **Location Preferences** (20 points): Accounts for geographic and remote work options.
-   **Job Type** (10 points): Awards bonus points for remote/hybrid positions.
-   **Salary Information** (15 points): Evaluates competitiveness of compensation.
-   **Experience Match** (10 points): Ensures alignment with appropriate experience levels.

**Decision Thresholds:**

-   **Apply** (70+ points): Jobs are automatically considered for application.
-   **Review** (45-69 points): Manual review is recommended for these jobs.
-   **Skip** (<45 points): Jobs are deemed not suitable for application.

### Worker Management Flow

```
User Action → Worker Pool → Document Generation → Folder Management → Quality Monitoring → Dashboard Update
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

```
Coordinator

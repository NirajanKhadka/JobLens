# Complete Scraper Fixes - July 19, 2025

## 🎯 **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Database Saving Failures** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: URLs were failing to save to database due to incorrect data structure
**Root Cause**: Scrapers were passing `job_id` field which conflicts with database auto-generation
**Solution**: Removed manual `job_id` field and fixed data structure to match JobRecord class

### 2. **Hanging on Job Processing** ✅ ALREADY FIXED
**Problem**: Scrapers would hang indefinitely on certain job links
**Root Cause**: No timeout handling for async operations
**Solution**: Added comprehensive timeout handling with `asyncio.wait_for()`

### 3. **Inconsistent URL Extraction** ✅ IMPROVED
**Problem**: Some job URLs weren't being extracted properly
**Root Cause**: Multiple different link formats and JavaScript redirects
**Solution**: Enhanced URL extraction with multiple fallback methods

# AutoJobAgent — Integration Report  
*(last updated : 2025-06-07)*  

---

## 1  Scope of Work Completed
| Area | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Directory Layout** | Re-created canonical structure exactly as specified, preserving original folder names while migrating the richer code-base. |
| **Core Modules** | Integrated fully-implemented versions of: `main.py`, `job_scraper.py`, `document_generator.py`, `utils.py`. |
| **ATS Automation** | Added/merged submitters for **Workday**, **iCIMS**, **Greenhouse** under `ats/` and provided **Lever** stub for future work. |
| **Dashboard** | Ported FastAPI + WebSocket dashboard (`dashboard_api.py` + modernized `templates/index.html`). |
| **Profile Schema** | Simplified JSON schema retained; ensured *keywords* field mandatory. Added default/fallback values inside `utils.load_profile`. |
| **PDF Conversion** | Implemented Windows Word-COM first; graceful fallback to DOCX copy when COM unavailable. |
| **Logging** | Excel (`openpyxl`) primary log with robust retry & CSV fallback. |
| **Session Handling** | Auto-creates/updates `session.json`; supports pause/resume via IPC and dashboard buttons. |
| **Hash & Duplicate Guard** | Deterministic MD5-based 10-char hash in `utils.hash_job` used across log, session, file names. |
| **Tests & Runner** | Added `test_integration.py` covering imports, directory structure, profile load, ATS detection, hashing, PDF, Ollama ping. Included `run_tests.bat` convenience script. |
| **Place-holders** | Stub DOCX templates and Lever submitter documented for user replacement/extension. |
| **Requirements** | Consolidated `requirements.txt` to minimal but complete dependency list. |
| **README** | Comprehensive quick-start documentation authored. |
| **.gitignore** | Added to keep generated artefacts & secrets out of VCS. |

## 2  Key Fixes Performed
| File | Fix |
|------|-----|
| `document_generator.py` | Replaced erroneous `utils.datetime` call with `datetime` import; added detailed helper functions. |
| `utils.py` | Hardened path handling, created temp-file helper, added Excel creation & retry logic, IPC pause utility. |
| `main.py` | Implemented Rich UI, argument parsing, batch loop, ATS selection, error handling, dashboard spawn. |
| `ats/*` | Unified common helpers via `BaseSubmitter`; improved CAPTCHA, resume/cover attach, navigation flows. |
| `dashboard_api.py` | Added stats aggregation, live WebSocket broadcasts, pause/resume endpoints, connection manager. |
| Misc. | Ensured all modules import without circular errors; added missing imports; corrected relative paths. |

## 3  What Works Today
✔️ Run `python main.py Nirajan` and the CLI will:  

1. Validate profile & convert PDFs (Word or fallback).  
2. Launch Chromium (headed by default).  
3. Scrape Indeed (HTML) → Eluta (Playwright) and create batches.  
4. Tailor résumé & cover letter with **Ollama** (if running).  
5. Detect ATS (or manual mode) and upload, log, de-duplicate.  
6. Serve dashboard at `http://localhost:8000` with live stats & pause.  
7. Persist progress in `profiles/Nirajan/session.json`.

`pytest` ready; `test_integration.py` passes on a vanilla Win-10 VM with Word & Ollama installed.

## 4  Outstanding / Future Work
| Priority | Item |
|----------|------|
| ⭐⭐⭐ | **Provide real DOCX templates** — replace placeholders under `profiles/Nirajan/`. |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | **Playwright browsers** — run `playwright install chromium` after venv setup. |
| ⭐⭐ | Modularise scrapers into `scrapers/` sub-package (current code still monolithic). |
| ⭐⭐ | Improve AI retry logic & rate-limit handling for Indeed/Eluta. |
| ⭐⭐ | Implement Lever submitter (`ats/lever.py`). |
| ⭐ | Add Google-Jobs & LinkedIn scraping stubs. |
| ⭐ | Wire GitHub Actions CI using `/tests` once more tests are authored. |

## 5  What You Need To Do Next
1. **Install prerequisites**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv && .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install chromium
   ollama pull mistral:7b      # if not already pulled
   ```

2. **Populate profile templates**  
   Replace `Nirajan_Resume.docx` and `Nirajan_CoverLetter.docx` placeholders with real documents.

3. **Run Smoke Tests**  
   ```bash
   python test_integration.py
   ```

4. **Start the agent**  
   ```bash
   python main.py Nirajan
   ```

5. **Open Dashboard** → <http://localhost:8000>  

6. **Pause / Resume** anytime from dashboard or `IPC` file (`output/ipc.json`).

## 6  Troubleshooting Quick-Table

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Word COM error | Word not installed / wrong bitness | Install 64-bit Word; or run with `--ats manual`. |
| Browser closes instantly | Playwright not installed | `playwright install chromium`. |
| Ollama 503 | Daemon not running | `ollama serve` or restart service. |
| Excel file locked | You opened log in Excel | Close Excel; agent retries automatically. |
| CAPTCHA blocks flow | Rate-limited | Solve manually in browser; press *Enter* when ready. |

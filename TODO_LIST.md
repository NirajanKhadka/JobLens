- [x] Fixed import paths and tested functionality
- [x] All CLI commands working correctly

### âœ… COMPLETED: Core Utils Modularization
- [x] Split large `src/core/utils.py` (784 lines) into modular components:
  - [x] `src/core/job_data.py` - JobData class and related utilities
  - [x] `src/core/text_utils.py` - Text processing utilities (clean_text, extract_keywords, analyze_text, etc.)
  - [x] `src/core/job_filters.py` - Job filtering utilities (JobFilter, FilterCriteria, etc.)
  - [x] `src/core/session.py` - Session management utilities (SessionManager, RateLimiter, etc.)
  - [x] `src/core/browser_utils.py` - Browser automation utilities (BrowserUtils, TabManager, etc.)
  - [x] `src/core/exceptions.py` - Custom exceptions
- [x] Updated imports and dependencies
- [x] Tested all new modules for import compatibility
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

### âœ… COMPLETED: Job Database Modularization (Partial)
- [x] **src/core/job_record.py** - JobRecord dataclass and related utilities
- [x] **src/core/db_engine.py** - Database connection pooling and initialization
- [x] Updated imports and tested functionality
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility

### âœ… COMPLETED: CLI Queue Processing Feature
- [x] Added `process_queue_action()` to ScrapingActions
- [x] Added menu option "6" for processing jobs from queue
- [x] Added CLI command `--action process-queue`
- [x] Implemented job detail scraping from URLs in queue
- [x] Added proper session management for queue processing
- [x] Tested CLI functionality

### ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: Remaining Large Files to Modularize
- [ ] **src/scrapers/big_data_patterns.py** (603 lines) - Break into data processing modules
- [ ] **src/scrapers/modern_job_pipeline.py** (612 lines) - Break into pipeline components
- [ ] **src/scrapers/parallel_job_scraper.py** (520 lines) - Break into parallel processing modules
- [ ] **src/core/job_database.py** (772 lines) - Complete modularization (CRUD operations, utilities)
- [ ] **src/core/utils.py** (784 lines) - Further modularization if needed

### ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: Clean Termination & Process Management
- [ ] Implement proper PowerShell window management
- [ ] Close old PowerShell windows when opening new ones
- [ ] Avoid having multiple PowerShell windows running simultaneously
- [ ] Ensure clean test environment for each test run
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: When main program terminates, ensure all related processes terminate
- [ ] Add signal handlers for graceful shutdown
- [ ] Implement process cleanup on exit
- [ ] Add browser cleanup and connection closing
- [ ] Add database connection cleanup

### ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: Testing Protocol
- [ ] **ALWAYS run tests after modularization** - to catch issues early
- [ ] Find and fix all imports after each modularization step
- [ ] Test CLI functionality after each change
- [ ] Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage for new modules

## Regular Items (Rest of List)

### Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite after each modularization
- [ ] Update test imports to use new modular structure
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass with new modular architecture
- [ ] Test CLI functionality with modular structure
- [ ] Add integration tests for new queue processing feature

### Documentation and Maintenance
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new modular structure
- [ ] Update ISSUE_TRACKER.md with modularization progress
- [ ] Create architecture documentation for new modules
- [ ] Update README with new module structure
- [ ] Document new CLI queue processing feature

### Performance and Optimization
- [ ] Monitor performance impact of modularization
- [ ] Optimize imports and dependencies
- [ ] Ensure no circular dependencies in new modules
- [ ] Profile memory usage with new structure
- [ ] Optimize queue processing performance

### Code Quality
- [ ] Ensure all new modules follow consistent coding standards
- [ ] Add proper type hints to all new modules
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all new functions
- [ ] Run linter checks on all new modules
- [ ] Add error handling for queue processing

## Notes

- **PowerShell Management**: When opening new PowerShell windows for testing, always close old ones first to avoid multiple windows running simultaneously
- **Testing Protocol**: Run tests after each major change to ensure stability
- **Import Strategy**: Use `src.` prefix for imports in test files when needed
- **Issue Tracking**: Update ISSUE_TRACKER.md with each completed modularization step
- **Clean Termination**: Ensure all processes, browsers, and connections are properly closed when main program exits
- **Queue Processing**: New feature allows processing jobs from queue by scraping details from URLs
